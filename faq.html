        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <p>Although many people around the world have heard of Mardi Gras, there are many questions that surround the
            event for people who do not live in New Orleans. Below is a list of the most frequently asked questions
            about Mardi Gras.</p>

        <button class="accordion">1: Is there an "official" Mardi Gras? </button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>No! Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It belongs to everyone.
                <br>
                Do not believe the
                claims of businesses who offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an "official" Mardi Gras website.
                Using the term “official” is just a way for vendors to sell their products or services to those who do
                not know better.
                <br>
                Products or websites are not licensed by the government for Mardi Gras. Each individual
                parade krewe is responsible for all of its merchandise. In some parts of the country, official
                organizations control their Mardi Gras celebration, but this is not true in New Orleans.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">2: When does Mardi Gras start and end?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, which is King’s Day (Feast of the Epiphany). Mardi Gras day
                (Fat Tuesday), however, is on a different day each year.
                <br>
                <br>
                Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year. Fat Tuesday
                is always the day before Ash Wednesday.
                <br>
                <br>
                Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day and stay through Ash
                Wednesday. Check out our dates page to see when Fat Tuesday will fall through the next few years.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">3: How much does it cost to go to Mardi Gras?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>It's free! Not only that, but you'll leave with bags of Mardi Gras beads and throws.
                <br>
                That's why we call
                it the "Greatest Free Show on Earth!"</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">4: What are the best ways to get around New Orleans once I've arrived?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The best methods of transportation will be via taxi/ride-sharing services, streetcar or rental car
                depending on where you're staying.
                <br>
                Driving your own car and finding parking spots will be difficult.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">5: Why does Mardi Gras fall on different dates each year?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The date of Mardi Gras changes every year because it's connected to Easter, which can fall on any Sunday
                between March 23 and April 25.
                <br>
                Mardi Gras day always takes place 47 days before Easter.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">6: What can I do to keep my family safe at parades?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Cameras are now up along most of the popular New Orleans parade routes and are connected to the city's
                new real-time monitoring center.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">7: I only have limited time. What is the prime time to visit during Mardi Gras?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The weekend before Fat Tuesday is the prime time to visit New Orleans for Mardi Gras. This is the weekend
                when Bacchus and Endymion, two of the biggest parades of the season, roll down the streets of New
                Orleans. The streets are packed all day Saturday and Sunday with parade watchers. If you can stay longer
                than a weekend, Monday (Lundi Gras) and Fat Tuesday are also great days to experience Mardi Gras.
                Orpheus, another big parade, rolls on that Monday night, and the Zulu Lundi Gras festival goes on all
                day. On Fat Tuesday, walking around the French Quarter and seeing all of the costumes and masks is a
                unique and thrilling experience.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">8: What should I do with all of the throws?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <img src="images/faq8.png" alt="floats" class="img-faq">
            <p>After a few floats, you may have so many beads around your neck, you’ll need a place to put them! Be sure
                to bring a bag to store all the beads, trinkets, coconuts and doubloons you’ll catch right off the
                float.
            </p>
